# TODO List

## Description

The TODO Application is a simple web-based task management tool built with Flask. It allows users to add, view, and mark
tasks as completed. The application uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Bootstrap for the front-end design.

## Usage

### Adding a Task

- Fill out the description field and submit the form.
- The new task will appear on the homepage.

### Marking a Task as Completed

- Click on the "Mark as Completed" button next to a task on the homepage.
- The task's status will be updated to "COMPLETED" and will no longer be listed as pending.

### Key Features

- **Task Management:** Add, view, and mark tasks as completed.
