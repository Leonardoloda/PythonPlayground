# Tit Tac Toe

## Description

The Tic Tac Toe Application is a simple Python-based console game that allows two players to take turns and play the
classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game checks for a winner after each turn and announces the winner when a winning condition
is met.

## Usage

### Start the Game:

When you run main.py, the game will start, and the first player (X) will be prompted to take their turn.

### Take Turns:

Players take turns entering the row and column number where they want to place their marker (X or O). The grid will be
updated and displayed after each turn.

### Winning the Game:

The game automatically checks for a winner after each turn. If a player wins, the game announces the winner and ends.

### Invalid Moves:

If a player tries to place their marker in a cell that is already occupied, the game will prompt them to choose another
cell.

### Ending the Game:

The game continues until one player wins or all cells are filled without a winner (this condition is not currently
handled for a draw).
