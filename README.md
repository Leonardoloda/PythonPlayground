## Introduction

This repository is a collection of Python projects developed during the "100 Days of Python Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. Each
project is designed to enhance your understanding of Python, covering a wide range of topics from basic syntax to
advanced concepts.

## Installation

To run these projects locally, you'll need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

4. Install the required packages:

cd Blackjack

python main.py
```

## Project Details
